# 1 Introduction

The main goal of this project is to create a machine learning model capable of predicting students' grades based on their habits.  
The process includes:
- [Data Gathering](#21-getting-data)  
- [Exploratory Analysis](#22-exploratory-analysis)  
- [Preprocessing](#23-preprocessing-data)  
- [Feature/Model Selection](#24-feature-selection)  
- [Pipeline Creation](#25-pipeline)  
- [Result Analysis](#26-results)  

In summary, the project
