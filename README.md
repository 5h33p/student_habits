# 1 Introduction

The main goal of this project is to create a machine learning model capable of predicting students' grades based on their habits.  
The process includes:
- [Data Gathering](#21-getting-data)  
- [Exploratory Analysis](#22-exploratory-analysis)  
- [Preprocessing](#23-preprocessing-data)  
- [Feature/Model Selection](#24-featuremodel-selection)
- [Model Train and Test](#25-model-train-and-test)
- [Pipeline Creation](#26-model-training-pipeline)  
- [Result Evaluation](#27-evaluation-results)  

In summary, the trained model was able to get better results than a dummy model used by compairison. The Python notebook [Development](./Development.ipynb) is divided according to the sections presented in this document.

# 2 Body

This section presents the process of getting, processing and loading the data (**ETL**), as well as the methods used to **select the features**, **create the regression model**, **search** for the **best hyperparameters**, **train the final model**, **create the pipeline** and **evaluate** the **results** based on the results of a dummy model.

## 2.1 Getting Data

Firstly, the data was extracted from a [Kaggle repository](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aryan208/student-habits-and-academic-performance-dataset) and the first rolls printed to check the data columns, rows and null values. A copy of the dataframe was also uploaded in case the kaggle dataset source is no more available. The dataframe has 31 columns, which of them 30 are features (student_id, age, gender, etc.) and one is the target (exame_score).
