# ðŸ§  Student Grade Predictor

This project predicts student exam scores using machine learning based on their lifestyle and habits. 

ðŸ“Œ **Key Steps**
- Data preprocessing (scaling, encoding)
- EDA (heatmaps, scatter plots)
- Model training with pipelines (Linear Regression, Ridge, Lasso, SVR)
- Performance evaluation (RÂ², MSE, MAE)
- Comparison with dummy baseline

ðŸ“Š **Tools:** Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Seaborn


# 1 Introduction

The main goal of this project is to create a machine learning model capable of predicting students' grades based on their habits.  
The process includes:
- [Data Gathering](#21-getting-data)  
- [Exploratory Analysis](#22-exploratory-analysis)  
- [Preprocessing](#23-preprocessing-data)  
- [Feature Selection](#24-feature-selection)
- [Model Train and Test](#25-model-train-and-test)
- [Pipeline Creation](#26-model-training-pipeline)  
- [Result Evaluation](#27-evaluation-results)  

In summary, the trained model was able to get better results than a dummy model used by comparison. The Python notebook [Development](./Development.ipynb) is divided according to the sections presented in this document.

# 2 Body

This section presents the process of getting, processing and loading the data (**ETL**), as well as the methods used to **select the features**, **create the regression model**, **search** for the **best hyperparameters**, **train the final model**, **create the pipeline** and **evaluate** the **results** based on the results of a dummy model.

## 2.1 Getting Data

Firstly, the data was extracted from a [Kaggle repository](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aryan208/student-habits-and-academic-performance-dataset) and the first rolls were printed to check the data columns, rows and null values. A copy of the dataframe was also uploaded in case the kaggle dataset source is no more available. The dataframe has 31 columns, which of them 30 are features (*student_id*, *age*, *gender*, etc.) and one is the target (*exame_score*).

## 2.2 Exploratory Analysis

This section presents the exploratory analysis conducted in order to visualize any correlation between features and exame score. In order to achieve this result, heat maps and scatter plots were applied on the data.


The numerical features were separated and their correlation summarized in the [heatmap](#heatmap) showed next.

<img id='heatmap' width="1272" height="766" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c3e4bdb4-bc6b-44f0-883e-c29fca363734" />

The heatmap results demonstrate that the *exam_score* column has some correlation with the following numerical features:
|Feature|Correlation|
| --- | --- |
|[*study_hours_per_day*](#study-hours-plot)|  +
|[*sleep_hours*](#sleep-hours-plot) |  +
|*exercise_frequency* |  +
|[*previous_gpa*](#previous-gpa-plot) |  +
|[*stress_level*](#stress-level-plot)|  -
|[*screen_time*](#screen-time-plot) |  +
|[*motivation_level*](#motivation-level-plot) |  +
|[*exam_anxiety_score*](#exam-anxiety-plot)|  -

A correlation scatter plot is available for most of these features in the [Appendix](#appendix) section. No further exploratory analysis was conducted on the data.

## 2.3 Preprocessing Data
This section shows the preprocess applied to the dataset, applying feature **scaling**.


Firstly the each column was converted to the right data type, between (float64, int64 or object). The Sklearn function `ColumnTransformer()` used in the preprocessing needs the categorical and numerical features to be named, leading to the classification between **categorical** and **numerical features**. The process demands less lines, since the entire dataset already had the right data types. The entire preprocessing step is shown below.

```python
# Separating features from scores
X = data.drop('exam_score', axis=1)
y = data.exam_score
data.study_hours_per_day = data.study_hours_per_day.astype(float)
categorical_data = X.loc[:, (X.dtypes=='object') | (X.dtypes=='category')] #Getting categorical data to preprocess
# print(categorical_data.nunique())

# Separating categorical and numerical data column names
cat_columns = categorical_data.columns
num_columns = X.drop(cat_columns, axis=1).columns

# Creating ColumnTransformer object
preprocessor = ColumnTransformer(
    transformers=[('num', StandardScaler(), num_columns),
                  ('cat', OneHotEncoder(handle_unknown='ignore', drop='first'), cat_columns)])

# Fitting preprocessor to the data
processor = preprocessor.fit(X)
X = processor.transform(X)
X = pd.DataFrame(X, columns=processor.get_feature_names_out())
```

Once the features are preprocessed, we can move on to the next step since this is a regression model and therefore there is no need of scaling the output.

## 2.4 Feature Selection
This section demonstrates the process of **feature selection**, where four different feature selection methods where employed:
- Information Gain
- Fisher's Score
- Correlation Coefficient
- Variance Threshold

The next table presents the ten best features according to each feature selection method.

| | Info | Fisher | Correlation | Variance
-- | -- |-- |-- |-- |
1 | previous_gpa |previous_gpa| previous_gpa| social_activity
2 |motivation_level |motivation_level |motivation_level |exam_anxiety_score
3 |exam_anxiety_score |study_hours_per_day |study_hours_per_day| social_media_hours
4 |study_hours_per_day| exam_anxiety_score |exam_anxiety_score |screen_time
5 |screen_time |screen_time |screen_time |time_management_score
6 |study_environment_Dorm |study_environment_Dorm| study_environment_Dorm| parental_support_level
7 |sleep_hours |access_to_tutoring_Yes |access_to_tutoring_Yes |stress_level
8 |stress_level |stress_level |stress_level |mental_health_rating
9 |social_activity |dropout_risk_Yes |study_environment_Quiet Room |student_id
10 |attendance_percentage_90.0| sleep_hours |sleep_hours| age

The ten features selected to train the model were the mode (most frequent features) from the results. The selected features are presented in the folowing list.

- previous_gpa: the student's last grade
- motivation_level: a motivation score of the student ranging from 0 to 10
- study_hours_per_day: number of hours studied by the student
- exam_anxiety_score: an anxiety score ranging from 0 to 10
- screen_time: number of hours spend by the student on a screen
- study_environment_Dorm: whether the student's study environment is his dormitory
- access_to_tutoring_Yes: wheter the student has access extraclass classes
- stress_level: a stress level score of the student ranging from 0 to 10
- dropout_risk_Yes: whether the student has dropout risk
- sleep_hours: daily hours of sleep of the student

## 2.5 Model Train and Test

This section presents the training process, as well as the metrics used to select the regression model. In order to get the best model, 3 different regression models were considered and tested:
- Linear Regression
- Lasso
- Ridge
